## Design

### Design Choices

The website was designed to evoke the feeling of discovering artefacts on an archaeological dig.
The dark background hints at treasures long hidden away from sight and highlights the dazzling brilliance of the images.

### Colour

### Fonts

Chosen from Google fonts and recommended by https://bootcamp.uxdesign.cc/10-google-font-pairings-for-your-next-design-project-8e29f46c788c, the pairing gives a clean look with similar curvatures and vertical letter heights for easy reading. 

### Structure

The structure is simple and straightforward with only one page. There is a clear navigation bar at the top so users can easily move to other parts of the site and navigation elements at the bottom of each section to return to the top of the page. Each section is defined by a header to inform the user what the section is about. Sections are:
    - Home page with title and navigation bar
    - Discovery of a Lifetime with images and historical information
    - To visit or find out more with links to other sources of information about Sutton Hoo
    - A sign up form to receive monthly emails about the ship rebuild project

## Bugs

- Icons for links in the footer not appearing. Realised I'd forgotten to add the Font Awesome script. Added the script and the icons appeared.

- Icon for last link to NT in footer still not appearing, even after adding the Font Awesome Script. Tried moving the script to the head of the html document as indicated by the Font Awesome Site but this did not help.

- Checked terms and conditions on NT website - 

        "11. Linking to the Site
