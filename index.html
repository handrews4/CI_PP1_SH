                <p>Amateur archaeologist Basil Brown famously made the discovery of a lifetime back in 1939,
                     when he brushed away the Suffolk soil and revealed the richest intact early medieval grave in Europe.
                      More than a grave, it was a spectacular funerary monument on an epic scale: a 27m (88.6ft) long ship
                       with a burial chamber full of dazzling riches. 
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>Amongst the treasures he uncovered was the iconic Sutton Hoo helmet which was wrapped in cloth and
                     laid near the head. Although broken into over 800 pieces it has been carefully reconstructed. 
                     The face mask forms a dragon whose wings make the eyebrows and tail the moustache. Garnets 
                     line the eyebrows, but only one is backed with gold foil reflectors, perhaps a reference to the one-eyed god, Woden.
