                <p class="text">Amateur archaeologist Basil Brown famously made the discovery of a lifetime back in 1939,
                     when he brushed away the Suffolk soil and revealed the richest intact early medieval grave in Europe.
                      More than a grave, it was a spectacular funerary monument on an epic scale: a 27m (88.6ft) long ship
                       with a burial chamber full of dazzling riches. 
                </p>
                <br>
                <p class="text">Amongst the treasures he uncovered was the iconic Sutton Hoo helmet which was wrapped in cloth and
                     laid near the head. Although broken into over 800 pieces it has been carefully reconstructed. 
                     The face mask forms a dragon whose wings make the eyebrows and tail the moustache. Garnets 
                     line the eyebrows, but only one is backed with gold foil reflectors, perhaps a reference to the one-eyed god, Woden.

            <div id="middle-left">
                <p class="text">Although practically none of the original timber survived, the form of the ship was perfectly preserved.
                    Stains in the sand had replaced the wood but had preserved many construction details. Nearly all of the
                     iron planking rivets were in their original places.</p>
                     <br>
                <p class="text">As a body was not found, there was early speculation that the ship-burial was a cenotaph, 
                    but soil analyses conducted in 1967 found phosphate traces, supporting the view that a body had
                     disappeared in the acidic soil. Analysis of coins found in the grave give the date of the burial from
                      610-635AD. The high status of the objects found in the
                     grave suggest a royal burial and many believe the body to have been King Raedwald of East Anglia who 
                     died in 624AD.</p>

                <p class="text">The Sutton Hoo grave is remarkable for the majesty of its contents and its monumental scale.
                     But it also rewrote our understanding of a time that we had previously misunderstood. 
                     Post-Roman Britain was considered to have entered the Dark Ages where civilisation in 
                     all aspects of life declined. Sutton Hoo proved otherwise.</p>
                     <br>
                <p class="text">The imagery of soaring timber halls, gleaming treasures, powerful kings and spectacular 
                    funerals in the Old English poem Beowulf could no longer be read as legends, they were reality, 
                    at least for the privileged few in early Anglo-Saxon society.</p>
